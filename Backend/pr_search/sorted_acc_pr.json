Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis adds another check when loading legacy compact URLs so that their datasources are resolved correctly.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nIt appears that in older versions of Grafana, certain explore URLs in the \"compact\" format could have their datasource set on non-mixed queries using the name of the datasource. Prior to https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/66286 (up to v10.0.x), these were handled correctly because explore would take no action on modifying the queries [unless their datasource fields were not all the same](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/838cbf22da1a8df9d3a7ba3aa6a44d362dc3f4ac/public/app/features/explore/ExplorePaneContainer.tsx#L103-L107). Even if they were not, it would choose the datasource as set on the first query but retain the others to be treated as imported queries.\r\n\r\nIn Grafana 10.1.X this behavior changed to remove all queries whose `datasource` field was set and not equal to that of the root value. In particular, [the code assumes that if the field is set to a string then it is the datasource UID](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v10.2.5/public/app/features/explore/hooks/useStateSync/index.ts#L307-L310). Since it is instead the name in these URLs, the queries are removed by the filter.\r\n\r\nBy modifying the filter to allow the name these URLs work again correctly in the latest version of Grafana. Since the decision was made to continue supporting legacy URLs, it seems appropriate to fix this.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nThis is likely most useful for long term users of Grafana who may have older explore URLs sprinkled in docs, code comments, or other tooling.\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [x] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [x] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [x] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

Basically, all queried dataframes for all rules, for multiplpe evaluations in the past, needlessly.\r\n\r\nThe length of the history is based on `For` - and can be raised arbitrarily high with a long `for`. Even for rules with a `for` of 0, the length is hardcoded to 10 evaluations. For a typical rule with 3 query nodes, this results in 30 frames worth of series kept in memory (spread across states) when we only use 3 of them.\r\n\r\nBy creating a long `For` with many dimensions, you can write a rule that eventually consumes arbitrary memory and OOMs grafana provided the process does not restart.\r\n\r\nThis is a truly incredible amount of data in some cases on instances even with simpler alerting usage it can quickly dominate the entire memory space of unified alerting.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nLikely, most memory consumption of unified alerting across the board is occupied by this throwaway data.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply stores the most recent single evaluation, rather than a running slice of them.

    "body": "Noticed several bugs with row repeats. \r\n\r\nSee issues here: https://ops.grafana-ops.net/d/ddl5wm680ka2of/repeating-row-t?orgId=1&scenes&var-server=A&var-server=B&var-server=C&tab=queries\r\n\r\n**Bugs noticed** (all fixed)\r\n* Adding new viz breaks layout / repeated rows\r\n* Moving panel inside repeated row does not work, panel disappears \r\n* Removing row repeats does not remove the local value scope (so panels do get the full multi value, only the last repeated scoped value)\r\n* Cannot edit panel inside row after removing repeating from row\r\n* Excessive queries, when changing variable value (say removing a value) all panels first issue new queries (even with the row that is getting removed), then repeat happens and new queries are issued (even for panels inside rows where nothing changed).\r\n* When going into dashboard settings (or panel edit) and back triggers new repeat process and new queries \r\n\r\n**Changes / Fixes**\r\n* [x] Adding a visualization completely messes up the layout. This is caused by the row repeat sources positions are never updated when new panels are added (as the sources are only part of the row repeat behavior). Major change in this PR is to move to something more similar to what we do in old architecture. We treat the first row of children as sources. This should simplify other things.  \r\n* [x] Use deterministic repeat clone keys based on local variable value (Will do the same to panel repeats in a future PR) \r\n* [x] Fixes moving a panel inside a repeated row (did not work, as the row repeater only repeated it's sources and moving a panel inside a repeated row never updated it's sources) \r\n* [x] Fixed panel edit issue where the local value scope is lost (So the queries get the full multi var value). Now we use the first repeat scope. \r\n* [x] When setting row repeat we manually activate the row repeat behavior this causes bugs as the behavior is no longer deactivated / re-activated. Needs fix in scenes lib to activate new behaviors. Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/731\r\n* [x] When cloning sources the sources can now contain data, so no new queries are issued even though the variable scope for the SceneQueryRunner is different. Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/727\r\n* [x] When changing variable value the notification was also passed to all SceneQueryRunners inside all the repeated panels trigging new queries (even when their local value did not change). Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/729. This fix required a big work around to how the RowRepeatBehavior get's notified of the top level variable change as the behavior itself is nested under a local variable value after the first repeat process.    \r\n* [x] Skip repeat process when values are the same as last time \r\n\r\nUnsolved bugs that I do not know how to fix right now, I think we can fix later \r\n* Doing a full page reload of editing a panel inside a repeated row leads to unscoped state (ie full multi value variable value). That is because we go into panel edit before repeat process \r\n* Doing a full page reload of the \"view panel\" view on panels inside the first row results in unscoped full multi value value (same reason as above). \r\n\r\nBoth those two bugs are because the first row (The template source) all all referenced by their plain ids / keys.  Not really sure how to fix them yet. But given the bugs this PR fixes that are much more critical I think we can wait to fix them separately. \r\n\r\nMaybe in a future PR (this was what I originally started working on this morning) \r\n* [ ] Reuse row clone instances when possible \r\n\r\nFixes: #87536\r\n\r\n",

This is caused by the row repeat sources positions are never updated when new panels are added (as the sources are only part of the row repeat behavior). Major change in this PR is to move to something more similar to what we do in old architecture. We treat the first row of children as sources. This should simplify other things.  \r\n* [x] Use deterministic repeat clone keys based on local variable value (Will do the same to panel repeats in a future PR) \r\n* [x] Fixes moving a panel inside a repeated row (did not work, as the row repeater only repeated it's sources and moving a panel inside a repeated row never updated it's sources) \r\n* [x] Fixed panel edit issue where the local value scope is lost (So the queries get the full multi var value). Now we use the first repeat scope. \r\n* [x] When setting row repeat we manually activate the row repeat behavior this causes bugs as the behavior is no longer deactivated / re-activated. Needs fix in scenes lib to activate new behaviors. Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/731\r\n* [x] When cloning sources the sources can now contain data, so no new queries are issued even though the variable scope for the SceneQueryRunner is different. Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/727\r\n* [x] When changing variable value the notification was also passed to all SceneQueryRunners inside all the repeated panels trigging new queries (even when their local value did not change). Fixed in https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/729. This fix required a big work around to how the RowRepeatBehavior get's notified of the top level variable change as the behavior itself is nested under a local variable value after the first repeat process.    \r\n* [x] Skip repeat process when values are the same as last time \r\n\r\nUnsolved bugs that I do not know how to fix right now, I think we can fix later \r\n* Doing a full page reload of editing a panel inside a repeated row leads to unscoped state (ie full multi value variable value). That is because we go into panel edit before repeat process \r\n* Doing a full page reload of the \"view panel\" view on panels inside the first row results in unscoped full multi value value (same reason as above). \r\n\r\nBoth those two bugs are because the first row (The template source) all all referenced by their plain ids / keys.  Not really sure how to fix them yet. But given the bugs this PR fixes that are much more critical I think we can wait to fix them separately. \r\n\r\nMaybe in a future PR (this was what I originally started working on this morning) \r\n* [ ] Reuse row clone instances when possible \r\n\r\nFixes: #87536\r\n\r\n",

This includes values, which is the measured dataframe results for that series: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/6e4d35e1eedffacaa5de7f59d9ca6b3b3d2d4d58/pkg/services/ngalert/state/manager.go#L361-L368\r\n\r\nBut, the only code that ever reads this field, only looks at the most recent 1 evaluation. Any values in that slice beyond the last one are stored for no reason: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/6e4d35e1eedffacaa5de7f59d9ca6b3b3d2d4d58/pkg/services/ngalert/state/state.go#L467-L471\r\n\r\nThe state manager is storing every measured value for every series in every query, including intermediate dataframes. Basically, all queried dataframes for all rules, for multiplpe evaluations in the past, needlessly.\r\n\r\nThe length of the history is based on `For` - and can be raised arbitrarily high with a long `for`. Even for rules with a `for` of 0, the length is hardcoded to 10 evaluations. For a typical rule with 3 query nodes, this results in 30 frames worth of series kept in memory (spread across states) when we only use 3 of them.\r\n\r\nBy creating a long `For` with many dimensions, you can write a rule that eventually consumes arbitrary memory and OOMs grafana provided the process does not restart.\r\n\r\nThis is a truly incredible amount of data in some cases on instances even with simpler alerting usage it can quickly dominate the entire memory space of unified alerting.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nLikely, most memory consumption of unified alerting across the board is occupied by this throwaway data.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply stores the most recent single evaluation, rather than a running slice of them.

The order of items scheduled for evaluation is important because the index of element is used to calculate a delay. That delay can be up to 10 second (base interval of tick). Therefore, one time rule can be evaluated at time X + 5 second, and the next time, for example, Y = X+eval interval, at Y + 2 seconds and therefore the rule is evaluated 3 seconds earlier than it is supposed to.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important in HA mode where we rely on the fact that rules are evaluated at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\nAlerting users\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nOne possible downside of this change is that now all instances in HA mode will send the same query at pretty much the same time, which may cause some contention of the data source side. \r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [x] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [x] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [x] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

The order of items scheduled for evaluation is important because the index of element is used to calculate a delay. That delay can be up to 10 second (base interval of tick). Therefore, one time rule can be evaluated at time X + 5 second, and the next time, for example, Y = X+eval interval, at Y + 2 seconds and therefore the rule is evaluated 3 seconds earlier than it is supposed to.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important in HA mode where we rely on the fact that rules are evaluated at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\nAlerting users\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nOne possible downside of this change is that now all instances in HA mode will send the same query at pretty much the same time, which may cause some contention of the data source side. \r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [x] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [x] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [x] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

In this scenario, we might end up sending a new order of rules to the API, but omitting the filtered out rules. \r\nBecause of the API behaviour, this could result in rules being unintentionally deleted\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nAlerting users who wish to reorder their rules!\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\nFixes https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/83263\r\n",
