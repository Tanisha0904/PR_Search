Conversely, `spanEndTimeShift` shifts the end time for the logs query based on the span's end time.\r\n\r\nThis means the example had the values the wrong way around.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the values have been corrected to -1h for `spanStartTimeShift` and 1h for `spanEndTimeShift`, which will extend the logs query time range to 1 hour before the span's start time and up to 1 hour after the span's end time\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nThank you for sending a pull request!
