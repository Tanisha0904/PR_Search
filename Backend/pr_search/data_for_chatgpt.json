This is also part of the work to move to lowercased emails and logins.\r\n\r\n- Adds a migration that lowercases login or emails where we do not find a lowercased entry in the database for those users\r\n- Adds lowercasing of the parameters `login` and `email` for function calls of getting users\r\n- Removes `LOWER()` from query parameters, that was not using the indexes of the databases\r\n\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Tasks\r\n- [x] test cases for lowercasing logins\r\n- [x] test cases for lowercasing emails\r\n- [x] test with terraform provider and state change for the users\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nhttps://github.com/grafana/identity-access-team/issues/657\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nWe were initially querying the db with `LOWER(login)` which did not make use of our created indexes, causing the db to scan all rows.\r\n\r\nWithout the `LOWER()` operation, we now see that it is using the index correctly.\r\n```sql\r\nEXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT `id`, `uid`, `version`, `email`, `name`, `login`, `password`, `salt`, `rands`, `company`, `email_verified`, `theme`, `help_flags1`, `is_disabled`, `is_admin`, `is_service_account`, `org_id`, `created`, `updated`, `last_seen_at` FROM `user` WHERE (`user`.is_service_account = 0) AND (login=?)

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nAdd support for SSO settings when re-encrypting all Grafana secrets.

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a brief description of what the feature or update does.]\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a description of the problem the feature is trying to solve.]\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\n[Add information on what kind of user the feature is for.]\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n- Automatically closes linked issue when the Pull Request is merged.\r\n\r\nUsage: \"Fixes #<issue number>\", or \"Fixes (paste link of issue)\"\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\nThis PR adds two new sets of permissions that let administrators create custom roles to grant access to provisioning alert rules and notification configurations separately.\r\nIt does not replace already existing permissions.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\nTo allow Grafana Enterprise users to grant access to rules API but not notifications provisioning APIs\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\nThe new actions are not exposed independently.

Here are some tips:\r\n\r\n1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a brief description of what the feature or update does.]\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a description of the problem the feature is trying to solve.]\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\n[Add information on what kind of user the feature is for.]\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n- Automatically closes linked issue when the Pull Request is merged.\r\n\r\nUsage: \"Fixes #<issue number>\", or \"Fixes (paste link of issue)\"\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

        "title": "Alerting: Fix simplified routes '...' groupBy creating invalid routes",
        "body": "**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis bugfix has the following effects to simplified routing `GroupBy`:\r\n\r\n1. If any of the given labels are the special label `...`, then the generated route will contain only the special label `...`.\r\n2. No longer required to contain both `grafana_folder` and `alertname` labels. If `GroupBy` is overridden, any missing required labels will be added during route generation.\r\n3. Generated route's `GroupBy` will have the labels sorted consistently: first the required labels followed by any custom labels in sorted order.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug where selecting `...` as a label for simplified routing group by would generate an invalid route according to upstream standards thus preventing any further AM config saves until the simplified route `GroupBy` `...` label was removed.\r\n\r\nThere were a few ways to go about this fix:\r\n1. Modifying our copy of upstream validation to allow for `GroupBy` with mixed `...` and other labels.\r\n2. Modify our notification settings validation to prevent `GroupBy` with mixed `...` and other labels. \r\n3. Normalize `GroupBy` by on save.\r\n4. Normalized `GroupBy` by on route generation.\r\n\r\nOption 4. was chosen as the others have the following cons:\r\n1. Generated routes risk being incompatible with upstream/remote AM.\r\n2. Awkward FE UX when using '...'.\r\n3. Rule definition changing after save and potential pitfalls with TF diff.\r\n\r\nWith option 4. generated routes stay compatible with external/remote AMs, FE doesn't need to change as we allow mixed '...' with custom labels, and settings we save to db are the same as the ones requested.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it has the slight benefit of allowing us to hide the internal implementation details of `alertname, grafana_folder` from the user in the future, since we don't need to send them with every FE or TF request.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nUsers of simplified routing.\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\nFixes #86005, #84073\r\n\r\n\r\n[Peek 2024-04-11 19-27.webm](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/assets/8484471/f7957d80-7ec2-4162-97c1-b2bfff697697)\r\n",

Currently\n    this only supports the Node.js package resolution algorithm, via\n    `--pkg-importer=node`. For example, `@use \"pkg:bootstrap\"` will load\n    `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss`.\n\n##### JavaScript API\n\n-   Add a `NodePackageImporter` importer that can be passed to the `importers`\n    option. This loads files using the `pkg:` URL scheme according to the Node.js\n    package resolution algorithm. For example, `@use \"pkg:bootstrap\"` will load\n    `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss`. The constructor takes a single\n    optional argument, which indicates the base directory to use when locating\n    `node_modules` directories. It defaults to\n    `path.dirname(require.main.filename)`.\n\n##### Dart API\n\n-   Add a `NodePackageImporter` importer that can be passed to the `importers`\n    option.

This PR enables the `dashboardScene` feature toggle (using local storage) and sets up an extra `scenes` option on the cypress config.  The idea will be to run this \"scene\" e2e tests in a scheduled github action agains main branch to prevent increasing CI times.\r\n\r\nExplorations on this proposal: \r\n- #### Use the same e2e tests and modify them based on the feature toggle (failed)\r\n\t- I tried to standardize e2e selectors across different flows (adding a dashboard)\r\n\t- Blocker: Some dashboard flows involve editing, it became cumbersome to achieve this, due to the new edit mode we added. I found myself adding a lot of conditionals for the existing e2e code to handle these cases\r\n- #### Duplicate e2e tests and refactor them to only align with the new flows (the changes on this PR) \r\n\t- Created a new folder called `scenes` in the `e2e` folder and duplicated some of the suites that have dashboard logic \r\n\t- Added an extra option called `scenes` on the cypress config, it will only run the e2e that are on that `scenes` folder\r\n\t- Added a new command to enable the feature toggle via local storage \r\n\t- Started to refactor all the tests and flows to accommodate the new UX flow (the edit mode)\r\n\r\n##### E2E tests migrated\r\n- `smoke-tests-suite`\r\n\t- [x] 1-smoketests\r\n\t- [x] panels_smokecreen\r\n- `dashboard-suite`\r\n\t- [x] import-dashboard.spec.ts \r\n\t- [x] embedded-dashboard.spec.ts\r\n\t- [x] dashboard-browse.spec.ts   \r\n\t- [x] dashboard-live-streaming.spec.ts \r\n\t- [x] dashboard-timepicker.spec.ts     \r\n##### Todo\r\n- `dashboard-suite`\r\n\t- [x] Repeating_a_panel_horizontally.spec.ts  ----> This is not rendered with scenes?

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis update removes outdated information in step 8 of the Create the Azure AD application section to remove the Expires option from Never to Select an expiration period\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nOutdated docs\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nEveryone\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n- Automatically closes linked issue when the Pull Request is merged.\r\n\r\nUsage: \"Fixes #<issue number>\", or \"Fixes (https://github.com/grafana/support-escalations/issues/6304)\"\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes # https://github.com/grafana/support-escalations/issues/6304\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

When the `labelTypes` field is not present, we incorrectly assumed all labels are \"non indexed\" and we would use all labels as label filter expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the behavior. If the label type can not be determined, the label will be used as an indexed label and thus in the stream selector.\r\n",

        "body": "Backport 9ea104232964b62aa8fc9797b26c011c53fd5681 from #84598\n\n---\n\n#### Design Doc: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfG30i9wtMxRltJKnIeuuuPLsDno11UyGg_cND-49rQ/edit?usp=sharing )\r\n\r\n#### Depends on this PR ([scenes PR](https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/648))\r\n\r\nThis POC PR is part of Proposal 3\r\n\r\nIt is possible to run our e2e with a feature flag enabled by default.  This PR enables the `dashboardScene` feature toggle (using local storage) and sets up an extra `scenes` option on the cypress config.  The idea will be to run this \"scene\" e2e tests in a scheduled github action agains main branch to prevent increasing CI times.\r\n\r\nExplorations on this proposal: \r\n- #### Use the same e2e tests and modify them based on the feature toggle (failed)\r\n\t- I tried to standardize e2e selectors across different flows (adding a dashboard)\r\n\t- Blocker: Some dashboard flows involve editing, it became cumbersome to achieve this, due to the new edit mode we added. I found myself adding a lot of conditionals for the existing e2e code to handle these cases\r\n- #### Duplicate e2e tests and refactor them to only align with the new flows (the changes on this PR) \r\n\t- Created a new folder called `scenes` in the `e2e` folder and duplicated some of the suites that have dashboard logic \r\n\t- Added an extra option called `scenes` on the cypress config, it will only run the e2e that are on that `scenes` folder\r\n\t- Added a new command to enable the feature toggle via local storage \r\n\t- Started to refactor all the tests and flows to accommodate the new UX flow (the edit mode)\r\n\r\n##### E2E tests migrated\r\n- `smoke-tests-suite`\r\n\t- [x] 1-smoketests\r\n\t- [x] panels_smokecreen\r\n- `dashboard-suite`\r\n\t- [x] import-dashboard.spec.ts \r\n\t- [x] embedded-dashboard.spec.ts\r\n\t- [x] dashboard-browse.spec.ts   \r\n\t- [x] dashboard-live-streaming.spec.ts \r\n\t- [x] dashboard-timepicker.spec.ts     \r\n##### Todo\r\n- `dashboard-suite`\r\n\t- [x] Repeating_a_panel_horizontally.spec.ts  ----> This is not rendered with scenes?

        "body": "Backport 533bed6d94063da0785edd05feb2767f5fd1c6fb from #86006\n\n---\n\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis bugfix has the following effects to simplified routing `GroupBy`:\r\n\r\n1. If any of the given labels are the special label `...`, then the generated route will contain only the special label `...`.\r\n2. No longer required to contain both `grafana_folder` and `alertname` labels. If `GroupBy` is overridden, any missing required labels will be added during route generation.\r\n3. Generated route's `GroupBy` will have the labels sorted consistently: first the required labels followed by any custom labels in sorted order.\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug where selecting `...` as a label for simplified routing group by would generate an invalid route according to upstream standards thus preventing any further AM config saves until the simplified route `GroupBy` `...` label was removed.\r\n\r\nThere were a few ways to go about this fix:\r\n1. Modifying our copy of upstream validation to allow for `GroupBy` with mixed `...` and other labels.\r\n2. Modify our notification settings validation to prevent `GroupBy` with mixed `...` and other labels. \r\n3. Normalize `GroupBy` by on save.\r\n4. Normalized `GroupBy` by on route generation.\r\n\r\nOption 4. was chosen as the others have the following cons:\r\n1. Generated routes risk being incompatible with upstream/remote AM.\r\n2. Awkward FE UX when using '...'.\r\n3. Rule definition changing after save and potential pitfalls with TF diff.\r\n\r\nWith option 4. generated routes stay compatible with external/remote AMs, FE doesn't need to change as we allow mixed '...' with custom labels, and settings we save to db are the same as the ones requested.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it has the slight benefit of allowing us to hide the internal implementation details of `alertname, grafana_folder` from the user in the future, since we don't need to send them with every FE or TF request.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nUsers of simplified routing.\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\nFixes #86005, #84073\r\n\r\n\r\n[Peek 2024-04-11 19-27.webm](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/assets/8484471/f7957d80-7ec2-4162-97c1-b2bfff697697)\r\n",

If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a brief description of what the feature or update does.]\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\n[Add a description of the problem the feature is trying to solve.]\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\n[Add information on what kind of user the feature is for.]\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n- Automatically closes linked issue when the Pull Request is merged.\r\n\r\nUsage: \"Fixes #<issue number>\", or \"Fixes (paste link of issue)\"\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\nPlease check that:\r\n- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.\r\n- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.\r\n- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/contribute-release-notes/) doc.\r\n",

This happens because not all folders in the general settings select box are actually stored in the `navIndex`, so when this changes the dashboard scene `getPageNav` method doesn't find the new folder and returns `not-found`. This solution updates the `navIndex` to include selected folder in it so that the dashboard can pick it up easily and render it in the breadcrumbs.\r\n\r\nPermissions are accounted for by the folders select box in the settings page so we don't need to worry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grafana/grafana/assets/36818606/5a3ab752-c0dd-40ad-8b3b-0b87912c090b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/85547",

Previously an O(n) array-copying operation inside the innermost loop of jsdiff's base diffing code increased the overall worst-case time complexity of computing a diff from O(n\u00b2) to O(n\u00b3). This is now fixed, bringing the worst-case time complexity down to what it theoretically should be for a Myers diff implementation.\n-   [#&#8203;448](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/411) Performance improvement. Diagonals whose furthest-reaching D-path would go off the edge of the edit graph are now skipped, rather than being pointlessly considered as called for by the original Myers diff algorithm. This dramatically speeds up computing diffs where the new text just appends or truncates content at the end of the old text.\n-   [#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/351) Importing from the lib folder - e.g. `require(\"diff/lib/diff/word.js\")` - will work again now. This had been broken for users on the latest version of Node since Node 17.5.0, which changed how Node interprets the `exports` property in jsdiff's `package.json` file.\n-   [#&#8203;344](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/344) `diffLines`, `createTwoFilesPatch`, and other patch-creation methods now take an optional `stripTrailingCr: true` option which causes Windows-style `\\r\\n` line endings to be replaced with Unix-style `\\n` line endings before calculating the diff, just like GNU `diff`'s `--strip-trailing-cr` flag.\n-   [#&#8203;451](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/451) Added `diff.formatPatch`.\n-   [#&#8203;450](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/450) Added `diff.reversePatch`.\n-   [#&#8203;478](https://togithub.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/478) Added `timeout` option.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This matches the backend logic.\r\n- If a project is defined in a frontend legacy query it will be correctly migrated.\r\n- If the `metricType` property is defined in a legacy query it will be correctly migrated to the `filters` property.\r\n\r\nI've also cleaned up the migration effect as I found an edge case where a query would be migrated but then not actually used because another effect being called would wipe out the migrated query.\r\n\r\nAlso, updated the tests for these cases.\r\n\r\nFixes #70734 (there were two distinct issues in there but they've been bundled into one).",
